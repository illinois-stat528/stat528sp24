## Good Habits

* attend class and bring a computer
* obtain up-to-date materials from my **stat528sp24** repository before class starts
* load in datasets and run the code in the notes before class starts
* make sure that the notes compile 
* use your computer's terminal, it is less user-friendly but it is MUCH faster
* Stay centered and remember Hofstadter's Law, which describes the widely experienced difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. **Hofstadter's Law**: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
 

## Homework Hints

* get a jump start on the homework, do not wait until the last minute
* use caching when appropriate
* make sure that your assignment compiles when you complete a problem or stop working for the day
* push often
* do not jeopardize the entire assignment over one problem

### Course Information


This is an advanced introduction to generalized linear models and categorical data analysis with a focus on analyzing data from disciplines such as biostatistics, education, evolutionary biology, medicine, and sports. In this course you will learn how to conduct scientifically relevant data analyses using methodologically rigorous statistical techniques. For example, we have just experienced nearly three semesters of online learning due to COVID-19. Have you wondered about the impact of online learning? In this class we will explore and estimate the causal effects of online learning using causal effect estimators. In addition we are living in a region where soybean is a major crop. As such we will estimate significant gene markers that improve the photosynthetic process in soybeans using mixed-effects models. These analyses will develop your critical thinking skills as a statistician. We will also place a strong emphasis on statistical properties of presented methods. Furthermore, practical advantages, limitations, and comparisons of methods will be discussed. 

**Prerequisites**: [STAT 510](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/fall/STAT/510) or [STAT 527](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/fall/STAT/527). Familiarity with R, Git, and GitHub is helpful, but not required.


### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to conduct methodologically strong data analyses that can answer questions of scientific interest, specifically the students will: 

  - Analyze data

  - Develop critical thinking about the analysis of data and estimation procedures
 
  - Analyze and investigate fundamentals of exponential family theory
  
  - Develop a solid theoretical, computational, and practical understanding of generalized linear models and linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models, repeated measures designs, and aster models 
  
  - Apply version control software and develop reproducible technical reports


### Course Communication

We will use several forms of communication for this course. The website will be the one-stop-shop for all course information. Course announcements will be sent via email. Be sure you are regularly checking your `@illinois.edu` email account.

If you would like to communicate with the course staff, our preferred methods of communication, in order, are:

1. Office Hours
2. Discussion Forum (Ed) 
3. Email

Email should largely be reserved for private matters. As much as possible, we would appreciate you asking questions about the course where we can respond so that other students benefit from your questions! It's cliche to say, but if you have a question, someone else is probably thinking it!

### Office Hours

For Spring 2023, all office hours will be held **online** via Zoom. Time listed are Champaign local time.

| Staff and Link      | Day             | Time                |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ |


The office hour schedule is always subject to change, but the times above are the general expectation. As such, the dates and times will be posted each week along with the course materials.

Office hours are by far our preferred forum for discussing individual specific questions. In office hours, our response time will be literally instant. Also, since we are both present in the same physical location (or together on Zoom), follow-up is both expected, and easy. Using asynchronous forms of communication such as the discussion forum or email will have a slower response rate and a much lower communication bandwidth. In other words, please come to office hours!

When joining office hours, be prepared to share your screen! Assuming you are having a technical or coding issue, the easiest way for us to assist is for you to **show** us the problem.

Office hours will be a rather informal meeting. As such, if the instructor and a student are engaged in causal conversation not directly related to a pressing matter in STAT 528, like a homework question, please just jump into the conversation and interrupt! If office hours are "busy" the instructor may institute an informal queuing system, but the hope is to keep office hours more relaxed and informal.

If you would like to schedule a private meeting outside of regular office hours, please send an email suggesting two possible times, on two different days.^[A total of four suggested times.] We have a preference for time-slots directly adjacent to current office hours. *Please also indicate a brief agenda for the meeting.* Requests to schedule a meeting at a time less than 24 hours in the future are unlikely to be granted.


#### Discussion Forum

This course will use [**Ed**](https://edstem.org/) as our discussion forum. Here is the link to join: https://edstem.org/us/join/2XDtGp

Ed access and login information was sent via email.

Please register your account with your University email.^[Accounts registered with an email other than an `@illinois.edu` account will be removed.]

I generally check Ed within a day or two after it alerts me that a new topic has been posted. Thus you can often expect a response within two or three business days. If you need a quicker response, you should consider office hours as an alternative.


The course staff would strongly prefer the use of Ed to GroupMe or similar services not officially supported by the course. The course staff feels that a GroupMe may exclude members of the course, whereas all are welcome on Ed. Services like GroupMe also exclude course staff, which while understandable, tends to promote an adversarial relationship between students and their instructors. **We're all on the same team, so let's act like it.**


Private posts have been disabled. Any private matters should be discussed over email where your identity is known and private. Some anonymous posting is disabled. You may post anonymously to your classmates, but not the course staff.


#### Code Discussion

If your question is technical in nature, there are several steps you can take to insure a speedy response. 

First and foremost, you should ask Google before you ask the course staff. Take the error message you obtained and search it with Google. The ability to solve problems this way is an extremely value skill, possibly one of the most important you should learn (but are not taught) during your academic career. Make a legitimate effort to solve the problem on your own. You won’t always be able to, and if you can’t, post on Ed. (Or consider stopping by office hours.)

If you need to ask the course staff, include the following in your discussion forum post:

-  **All** code that is required to re-create the error.
  - Staff should be able to run your code, without any modification, and obtain the same error or output.
- The exact error message received.


Do not only use screenshots of code and error messages to communicate about them. Copy paste them so that others can copy-paste them as well. Posts containing screenshots of code will likely be deleted.


**In this course, for everything expect exams, we greatly prefer over-sharing to under-sharing code. We would rather everyone learn from others' "mistakes" than have everyone experience the same issues over and over again.** 


### Attendance Policy

Attendance is mandatory in STAT 528. Each student will sign their name and netid on a sign-in sheet provided by the course instruction to verify their attendance. This sign-in sheet must be signed within 15 minutes of class starting. Students who are late by more than 15 minutes will be considered absent. Students are allowed two free absences with no point deductions. Each absence after two will be penalized 20 points (2% of final grade). Additional absences can be granted provided the course instructor approves them. Requests for additional absences must be made at least 48 hours before the absence date.

### Grading Breakdown

| category | notes | points |
| :------- | :---- | :----- |
| Homework     | highest 6 of 7 counted each at 100 points | 600 points |
| Midterm Exam | | 150 points |
| Final Exam   | | 250 points |
| Absence      | 2 free absences; additional absences will be penalized | -20 points | 
| total | | 1000 points |


I will be using a +/- grading schema. The grade distributions will be: 

| Lower bound | Upper bound | Letter grade |
| :---------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 990 | 1000 | A+ |
| 933 | 989 | A |
| 900 | 932 | A- |
| 867 | 899 | B+ |
| 833 | 866 | B |
| 800 | 832 | B-|

and so on 


#### Homework

There are 7 assignments total and **your lowest assignment score will be dropped**. When completing the assignment, read it carefully, and follow the directions. For each homework assignment, you will submit two files - .Rmd and .html (or .pdf) - saving your files with your name and homework assignment number. **The homework naming convention is netid_HW#**.  For a student with netid *abc123* that is submitting HW4 files, their files would be saved as *abc123_HW4.Rmd* and *abc123_HW4.html* (or *abc123_HW4.pdf*). **Failure to adopt this homework naming convention will result in point deductions and headaches.**  Make sure your homework is neat, readable, and reproducible containing only relevant derivations, code, results, and explanations. You are expected to work on your homework individually since you are graded as an individual. **Questions about the grading should be directed to the TA**. 

Homework should be stored in a HW# directory in your GitHub repo that is a sub directory of a homework directory in your GitHub repo. For example, your fourth homework assignment should be saved in the directory

```
homework/HW4/
```

within your personal GitHub repo.  Failure to do this will result in point deductions.

**Late submissions of the homework will be accepted with a penalty.** There will be a 20 point deduction if an assignment is submitted 48 hours after the deadline. Assignments submitted later than 48 hours after the deadline will not be considered.

**Students must use GitHub to start, finish, and submit their Homework. More details will be discussed in class.**

Homeworks will be worth 100 points unless otherwise noted.


#### Exams
There will be two exams in this class. A midterm examination will be due on Friday, March 10th at 11:59 PM. The final examination will occur at the end of the semester, and it will be due on 05/11 at 11:59 PM. The final examination will be cumulative.

<!-- ### Final Grade Percentage & Letter Grade  -->
<!-- | Lower bound | Upper bound | Letter grade | -->
<!-- |---|---|---| -->
<!-- | 933 | 1000 | A | -->
<!-- | 900 | 932 | A- | -->
